# Local dev install for the Braintrust Codex plugins.
#
# Codex has no `--plugin-dir` flag. Plugins are loaded from a marketplace and
# COPIED into a versioned cache under ~/.codex/plugins/cache/. Codex validates
# that the cached plugin is a real directory under the cache root, so a symlink
# back to the repo does NOT work (Codex reports it as "not installed").
#
# This script therefore does a normal install (a copy) and re-syncs that copy
# on every run. Re-run it whenever you edit plugin files so Codex picks up the
# changes.
#
# What it does:
#   1. registers this repo as a local marketplace,
#   2. installs the plugin(s) so Codex copies them into the cache and writes the
#      correct config entries.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install.sh                            # install all plugins in this repo
#   ./install.sh trace-codex                # install just one plugin (by folder)
#
# Use ./uninstall.sh to remove.

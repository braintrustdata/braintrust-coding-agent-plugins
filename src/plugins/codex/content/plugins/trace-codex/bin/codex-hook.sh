# Launcher for the trace-codex hook binary.
#
# hooks.json invokes this script (a fixed, platform-agnostic command). The real
# binary is platform-specific and far too large to commit, so it is downloaded
# on demand from the plugin's GitHub release and cached next to this script at
# $PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/codex-hook.
#
# Because Codex wipes the versioned plugin cache ($PLUGIN_ROOT) on every
# install/upgrade, a cached binary there is automatically invalidated on
# upgrade: the next hook finds it missing and re-downloads the matching version.
# This means the hot path is just "is the binary here? exec it" with no version
# parsing, and upgrades self-heal with no manual step.
#
# Hard rule: never fail the Codex turn. Any error here logs to stderr and exits
# 0 (Codex treats a 0 exit with no stdout as success).

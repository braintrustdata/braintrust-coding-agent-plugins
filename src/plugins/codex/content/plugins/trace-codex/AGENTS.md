# AGENTS.md — trace-codex

Guidelines for AI agents working in the `trace-codex` plugin. This is the
opt-in plugin that traces Codex sessions to Braintrust. It is **independent**
from the MCP/skills plugin (`braintrust-codex-plugin`) — do not merge behavior
between them. See the [repo AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) for the monorepo
overview.

## What this plugin is

A long-lived, local **event server** plus a short-lived **hook client**, both
compiled into a single `codex-hook` binary. Codex fires lifecycle hooks; each
hook invocation runs the client, which forwards the event to the server, which
turns the stream of events into Braintrust spans (session → turn → tool).

## Architecture

Request/data flow:

```
Codex hook → bin/codex-hook.sh → codex-hook (client mode)
          → POST /enqueue → in-memory FIFO queue
          → ProcessorRegistry (one EventProcessor per session)
          → Braintrust spans
```

Key pieces:

- `src/index.ts` — entry point. One binary, three modes: `serve` (the
  background server), `hook` (default; read one event from stdin, enqueue it),
  and `replay` (re-POST a recorded NDJSON session).
- `src/client/` — the hook client. Ensures a server is up (booting a detached
  one if needed), POSTs events, and on a terminal event (`Stop`) calls `/flush`
  so final spans are delivered before the process tree is torn down.
- `src/server/` — the HTTP server, the FIFO `EventQueue`, routes
  (`/enqueue`, `/flush`, `/health`, `/shutdown`), and the idle watchdog.
- `src/processor/` — the generic `ProcessorRegistry` (LRU map of per-session
  processors) and the `EventProcessor` interface.
- `src/agents/codex/` — Codex-specific: translate hook payloads into
  `EnqueueEvent`s (`event-builder.ts`), build spans (`event-processor.ts`), and
  read user settings (`settings.ts`).
- `src/braintrust/` — thin wrapper over the Braintrust SDK (span factory).

The server is **single-version**: a client whose version doesn't match a running
server bails rather than talking to it. It shuts itself down after an idle
window (default 5 min) or on `/shutdown`.

The design has three deliberate properties worth understanding before changing
anything:

### 1. Agent-agnostic "event server"

The core (`src/server/`, `src/processor/`, `src/braintrust/`) knows nothing
about Codex. It speaks a generic `EnqueueEvent` shape and routes events to a
per-session processor. All Codex-specific knowledge lives in `src/agents/codex/`
and is registered into the generic core at startup. Adding another agent (Claude
Code, opencode, etc.) means adding a sibling `src/agents/<agent>/` module that
exports the same `Agent` shape — the server, queue, and registry should not need
to change.

Keep this boundary clean: nothing under `src/server/`, `src/processor/`, or
`src/braintrust/` should reference Codex by name. The generic event server may
eventually be extracted into its own package, so treat any Codex-specific leak
into the generic layers as a bug, not a shortcut.

### 2. Node-compiled, cross-platform binaries

The hook command in `hooks.json` is a fixed, platform-agnostic string that
invokes `bin/codex-hook.sh` (or `.cmd` on Windows), **not** the binary directly.
That launcher resolves and runs the real, platform-specific `codex-hook` binary.

- `scripts/build.ts` runs a two-step build: `tsup` bundles `src/index.ts` into a
  single self-contained CommonJS file (`dist/codex-hook.cjs`, inlining the
  `braintrust` dependency), then `@yao-pkg/pkg` wraps that bundle plus a Node
  runtime into a standalone executable per target (`darwin-arm64/x64`,
  `linux-x64/arm64`; Windows slots in but isn't built yet). `BUILD_HOST_ONLY=1`
  builds just the host target (used by the repo-root `install.sh` for local dev
  installs).
- **Build the release on macOS.** pkg code-signs the darwin binaries via the
  `codesign` utility (macOS-only), and Apple Silicon kills an unsigned arm64
  binary on launch. A macOS host cross-compiles the Linux targets too, so one
  job produces all four signed/valid binaries (see `release.yaml`).
- **Re-exec caveat (pkg):** the hook spawns the server by re-executing
  `process.execPath` with `serve`. pkg's child_process patch would otherwise make
  the child act like `node` and treat `serve` as a script path, so
  `spawn-server.ts` pre-sets `PKG_EXECPATH` to a non-exec-path sentinel to force
  packaged-app mode. See the comment there.
- The compiled binaries are **large and not committed**. The launcher downloads
  the matching binary from the plugin's GitHub release on first use and caches
  it at `$PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/codex-hook`. Codex wipes `$PLUGIN_ROOT` on every
  install/upgrade, so the cache self-invalidates and the next hook re-downloads
  the right version.
- Plugin version is the single source of truth in
  `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`; the launcher reads it to construct the release
  tag (`trace-codex-v<version>`).

**Hard rule:** the hook must never fail the Codex turn. The launcher and client
log to stderr and exit 0 on any error; the server swallows errors so a turn is
never blocked by tracing.

### 3. Hooks are non-blocking by default

Tracing must not degrade the experience of using the coding agent. Every hook
fires synchronously in Codex's path, so blocking work on a hook directly adds
latency to the user's session. The design therefore makes the common path
fire-and-forget: the client POSTs to `/enqueue` and returns immediately, while
the background server does the slow work (Braintrust SDK calls, flushes) off the
critical path.

The terminal event is the one place where blocking is even an option, and it's
**opt-in**:

- On a **terminal event** (`Stop`), the client calls `/flush` **only** when
  `BRAINTRUST_FLUSH_ON_TURN_END` is set, blocking until the server confirms the
  queue has drained and buffered spans reached Braintrust. The blocking mode
  exists for short-lived hosts (e.g. a CI job that ends right after the last turn)
  that would otherwise tear the process tree down before the final spans are
  delivered. When enabled, the wait is bounded by a timeout (`/flush` gives up
  rather than hanging the turn). By default the client does nothing on `Stop`: the
  long-lived server flushes on its own when the queue goes idle, so in normal
  interactive use no spans are lost and the turn isn't stalled by a flush request.

When adding behavior, prefer enqueue-and-return. Reach for a blocking
request/await only when data would otherwise be lost, keep it off the
per-hook hot path where possible, and always bound it so a slow or stuck backend
can't stall the agent.

### 4. Sessions can outlive the server (resume)

The server is short-lived (idle shutdown after ~5 min, or the user closes and
later resumes). A Codex session, though, can span that gap. To avoid dropping
the tail of a trace — or worse, re-emitting it as duplicate/orphaned spans — the
Codex processor **persists its resumable state** and rehydrates it when a new
processor is created for the same session id.

How it works:

- The transcript (rollout JSONL) on disk is the durable source of truth for span
  *content*. What a restart loses is the processor's in-memory bookkeeping:
  transcript byte offsets, which spans are still open (and their identities),
  the reconstructed conversation history, and the subagent/compaction side-maps.
- On every `flush()` (idle drain, eviction, terminal Stop, shutdown), the
  processor writes a JSON snapshot of that bookkeeping to
  `PLUGIN_DATA/state/<sessionId>.json` (`src/agents/codex/snapshot-store.ts`).
  Span handles are stored as identities (`span_id`/`root_span_id`/`parents` plus
  name/type), captured from the SDK's synchronous span getters.
- On its first event, a processor attempts a one-time restore for its session
  id. If a compatible snapshot exists, it recreates each span handle bound to the
  original id via `SpanFactory.rehydrateSpan` (Braintrust merges rows by
  `span_id`, so further `log()`/`end()` calls continue the same trace). Restore
  runs **before** the tracing-enabled master switch, because the snapshot also
  carries the session's reporting config (a bare mid-session restart may have no
  leading config event).
- The snapshot is **not** deleted when the root span ends. Codex's `Stop` hook is
  per-**turn**, not per-session (there is no session-end hook), and we end the
  root on the first `Stop` — but later turns still attach as children of that same
  root, so a restart *between* turns must be able to resume. The snapshot
  therefore persists past root-end; stale ones (sessions that never resume) are
  reclaimed by a startup GC sweep that removes snapshots older than a TTL.

Invariants to preserve when changing this:

- **Persistence is Codex-owned**, not part of the generic event server: *where* a
  plugin may persist state is the host agent's call (Codex gives us
  `PLUGIN_DATA`). Keep the store and snapshot shape under `src/agents/codex/`.
  The only generic addition is `SpanFactory.rehydrateSpan` (pure SDK behavior).
- **Never persist secrets.** The `apiKey` is stripped from the snapshot's
  reporting config and re-resolved from env / the config event on resume (mirrors
  the event recorder's redaction).
- **Never throw.** The store swallows and logs all I/O errors; a persistence or
  restore failure must not break a turn — it just falls back to starting fresh.
- **Version-gate snapshots.** Each carries `pluginVersion` + a schema version;
  a mismatch discards the snapshot. Bump `SNAPSHOT_SCHEMA_VERSION` in
  `state-snapshot.ts` whenever the shape changes incompatibly.

## Making changes

- **Generic vs. agent code**: put agent-specific logic in `src/agents/<agent>/`;
  keep the server/processor/braintrust layers agent-agnostic.
- **Config**: two layers. The agent-specific layer (`src/agents/codex/settings.ts`)
  reads the user's `config.json` from `PLUGIN_DATA`, maps its friendly camelCase
  keys onto `BRAINTRUST_*` / `BRAINTRUST_EVENT_SERVER_*` env vars (env wins over
  the file), and is run by the hook client before it boots the server — so the
  spawned server inherits the resolved env. The generic layer (`src/config.ts`)
  then reads **only** those env vars and never touches `config.json`. Keep it
  that way: config-file parsing is deliberately agent-specific. User-facing
  settings are documented in the [README](./README.md); update it (and the
  `Settings` map in `settings.ts`) when adding one.
- **Hooks**: `hooks/hooks.json` lists the lifecycle events wired to the client.
  Most are forwarded but not yet turned into spans (the processor no-ops the
  ones it doesn't handle).
- **Build**: edit `scripts/build.ts` for targets/output; the launcher scripts
  (`bin/codex-hook.sh`, `bin/codex-hook.cmd`) for download/exec behavior.

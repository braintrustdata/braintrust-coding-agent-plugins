#!/bin/sh
# End-to-end smoke test: run a real Codex session with the trace plugin enabled,
# pointed at a local mock Braintrust collector, and assert at least one trace row
# was reported.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/smoke-test.sh [VERSION]
#
# VERSION (optional; or the SMOKE_RELEASE_VERSION env var) pins the release whose
# codex-hook binary the plugin launcher downloads, e.g. "0.0.1" or "v0.0.1". When
# unset, the launcher uses the installed plugin manifest version (the normal
# behavior). CI passes the version it just released; locally you can point this
# at any published release.
#
# Prerequisites (the caller is responsible for these):
#   - `codex` is on PATH and authenticated for `codex exec` (we pass
#     CODEX_API_KEY from OPENAI_API_KEY below).
#   - The trace-codex plugin is installed and enabled in Codex (the CI workflow
#     installs it from the published release; locally use ./install.sh).
#   - node + pnpm are on PATH (used to run the mock collector via tsx), and the
#     plugin's dependencies are installed (`pnpm install` in the plugin dir).
#   - OPENAI_API_KEY is set.
#   - For a private release repo, GH_TOKEN or GITHUB_TOKEN (or an authenticated
#     `gh`) so the launcher can download the binary.
#
# Exit 0 on success (>=1 trace row received), non-zero otherwise.
